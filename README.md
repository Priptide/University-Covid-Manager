# University-Covid-Manager

Created as a project for university, can be used in a number of ways!

A system made to manage COVID tests around a campus between the hours of 7am-10am.

Will automatically add rooms, bookable rooms, assistants and assistants on shift on the day you use the program.

Simply follow the menu flow to allow yourself to add rooms and assistants, note all assistants and students must have emails ending in @uok.ac.uk

Feel free to use the program and edit it however you would like, it will also be a good idea to add a writing and reading element to the program in order to save the data of the current system and hence make it a more functional program!
